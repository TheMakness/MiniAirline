# ✈️ Mini Airline

Mini Airline is a **work-in-progress project** written in **C++ using SFML**, inspired by the game *Mini Airways*.  
The goal of this project is twofold:
1. **Practice and strengthen my C++ skills** through a complete game project.  
2. Experiment with **resource management and optimization mechanics** in a lightweight simulation game.

## 🎮 Gameplay Concept
*Mini Airline* is a minimalist **air traffic control simulation**.  
The player must guide planes safely through the airspace by managing their takeoff, flight paths, and landings in real time.  

Core gameplay revolves around:
- Assigning and adjusting flight routes.  
- Preventing collisions by managing timing and direction.  
- Handling an increasing number of planes as difficulty ramps up.  
- Expanding air traffic capacity through progressive challenges.  

The goal is to keep the airspace safe and efficient for as long as possible, balancing quick decisions with long-term strategy.  
*(Inspired directly by the fast-paced and strategic gameplay of **Mini Airways**.)*
